## Describe the use of beta testing. 

Beta testing is when a product is tested by real users in real-world conditions before it is fully released. This helps to find any problems and fix them. 


## Outline the role of the memory data register in the machine execution cycle

The memory data register (MDR) in the machine execution cycle is used to store data that is being transferred between the computer's memory and the processor. During the cycle, the MDR holds data that has either been fetched from the memory and is about to be used by the CPU, or data that is going to be stored in the memory. This helps the CPU interact efficiently with the memory components.
